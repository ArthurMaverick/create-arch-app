# Mvp

**Model–view–presenter** (**MVP**) is a derivation of the [model–view–controller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller) (MVC) [architectural pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architectural_pattern), and is used mostly for building user interfaces.

In MVP, the presenter assumes the functionality of the "middle-man".  In MVP, all presentation logic is pushed to the presenter.
